          The church grows not only because one generation knows God and follows
          Him, but the church also grows when one generation passes the Gospel
          to the next generation. We can see this in the lives of Paul and
          Timothy. In this lesson, we will learn the value of youth from God's
          perspective, from the perspective of previous generations, and from
          the perspective of the next generation.
